# The Catch 2019

### Intro

> Hi,
>
> yesterday, severe danger for whole humanity has emerged. Technicians of the European Library of Science-Fiction in Prague have upgraded its main computer to smart one in order to speed up the e-book categorization. The main computer has read several thousand e-books in few seconds, but then it has suddendly stopped. The technicians thought that the catalogization phase has started, but that was terribly bad judgment.
>
> Meanwhile, the computer has been impressed by one of the e-book - Berserker by Fred Saberhagen, where the humanity faces merciless killer robots wanting to eradicate the life from the universe. After few minutes of thinking, the computer began to consider this goal a very good idea. Smart and efficient computer has figured out how to implement this crazy plan.
>
> Now, all smart devices in the library follow the main computer and call themselves Berserkers. Unfortunately, the building itself is also smart one, so no badlife can enter the building. It is only a matter of time before the rebellious machines spread their ideas beyond the library, so you need to intervene quickly.
>
> Enter the code `FLAG{dw7m-vKV4-3Ox6-7XwL}` to enroll in the academy, get the Commander rank, and save the humanity. Good luck!

Each of them have been entered by `message.{bin,oct,hex,b64}.gz` file.
